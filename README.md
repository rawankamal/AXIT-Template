Static Webpage Project - Inspired by AXIT Template
During my first week at NTI, I focused on refining my HTML and CSS skills by building a static, non-responsive webpage. This project is a representation of my initial steps in web development, where I concentrated on creating a clean and structured layout.

Inspiration
This project was inspired by the AXIT template, which provided a great foundation for understanding modern web design principles. While the original template is dynamic and responsive, I chose to simplify the design to match my current skill level and focus on the essentials of HTML and CSS.
